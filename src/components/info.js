const cancerInformation = `Breast cancer occurs almost entirely in women, but men can get breast cancer, too.
Cancer starts when cells begin to grow out of control.
Itâ€™s important to understand that most breast lumps are benign and not cancer (malignant). Non-cancer breast tumors are abnormal growths, but they do not spread outside of the breast. They are not life threatening, but some types of benign breast lumps can increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer.
In this project we have created an ML Model which predicts if a breast lump is cancerous or not on the basis of data that is gleaned from a mammograph.
